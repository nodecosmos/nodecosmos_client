        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="bold mt-2"><b>Last updated: October 10, 2024</b></p>
        <p class="mt-1">This Privacy Policy describes our policies on the collection, use, and disclosure of your information when you use our Service. We value your privacy and are committed to being transparent about how we handle your data.</p>

        <h2>1. Data Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>We collect minimal data, only what is necessary to operate our Service effectively. This includes:</p>
        <ul class="mt-1">
            <li><strong>Session Data</strong>: Information collected during your session, such as IP address, browser type, and device information, for monitoring and improving our Service.</li>
            <li><strong>Google Analytics Data</strong>: We use Google Analytics to track and analyze traffic and usage trends. Google Analytics collects data such as IP addresses, browser types, and pages visited.</li>
            <li><strong>Contact Information</strong>: If you choose to contact us, we may collect your email address and other details you voluntarily provide. This information is used solely to respond to your inquiry.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We do not retain any personal data beyond what is necessary to provide our Service. Session data is not stored once your session ends, and any information you provide voluntarily is deleted once it is no longer needed for the purpose you provided it for.</p>

        <h2>3. Cookies</h2>
        <p>We use session-based cookies and Google Analytics cookies to ensure our Service functions correctly and to gather insights on usage. Google Analytics may place cookies to collect information on how you interact with our Service.</p>
        <p class="mt-1">Types of Cookies We Use:</p>
        <ul class="mt-1">
            <li><strong>Essential Cookies</strong>: These are necessary for the operation of our website. They allow us to manage sessions and ensure you can navigate our Service.</li>
            <li><strong>Google Analytics Cookies</strong>: These cookies help us analyze how our Service is used. For more information on Google Analytics cookies and data handling, please refer to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google’s Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do not share your data with third parties except in the following situations:</p>
        <ul class="mt-1">
            <li><strong>With Service Providers</strong>: We use Google Analytics to understand how our Service is used and improve user experience. Google may collect data on our behalf, which is subject to Google’s privacy policies.

            <li><strong>When Legally Required</strong>: We may share your data if we are legally required to do so, such as in response to a valid request from a government agency.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Security of Your Data</h2>
        <p>While we take measures to protect your data during your session, please remember that no transmission over the Internet is completely secure. We do not retain data after your session, reducing the risk associated with data storage.</p>
