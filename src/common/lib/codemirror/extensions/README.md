# Extensions
Extensions are a broad concept in CM6 that allow you to extend or modify the functionality of the editor. 
This can include adding new commands, key bindings, themes, language support, linting, and more. Extensions can be simple, 
like a keymap that binds a keyboard shortcut to a command, or complex, like a language support extension that provides
syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and linting for a specific programming language. Extensions often use fields and 
effects to manage their state and respond to changes in the editor.
