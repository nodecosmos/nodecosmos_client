# NodeCosmos

Nodecosmos is a collaborative product development platform that allows teams to structure projects,
model how things work step-by-step, and drive evolution through peer-reviewed proposalsâ€”all in one place.

### Directory & File structure: 
*  **pages** - Each route has associated page. Nested routes are handled with react router's `<Outlet />`
*  **common** - everything that does not relate to redux state
   * **components** - common view components
   * **hooks** - common business logic
*  **features** - each feature corresponds to a model in the database with an exception to the app and home
   * **feature-name**
       *  **components** - view components
       *  **hooks** - domain specific logic
       *  **reducers** - (optional) state management for feature, usually used for large slices
          * **extra** - handle async actions usually defined within feature.thunks.js (createNode, updateNode, deleteNode...)
       *  **feature.thunks.js** - usually used for api calls but it can be used for async actions that require state changes from multiple reducers
       *  **feature.selectors.js** - used to select data from feature state
       *  **featureSlice.js** - state management for feature
